Once in a far away land, there lived a red dragon named Firebolt. Firebolt lived a mostly happy life, living in a castle and spending time with his dragon friends. But then, out of nowhere, catrastrophe struck! 
A dragon by the name of Ulysses was very angry. His coffee from the local dragontail cafe was much too hot for him! He ran down the street, and threw the coffee in Firebolt's innocent face.
