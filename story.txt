Once in a far away land, there lived a red dragon named Firebolt. Firebolt lived a mostly happy life, living in a castle and spending time with his dragon friends. But then, out of nowhere, catrastrophe struck! 
A dragon by the name of Ulysses was very angry. His coffee from the local dragontail cafe was much too hot for him! He ran down the street, and threw the coffee in Firebolt's innocent face.
Nearby, there was another dragon named Puff. He watched Ulysses throw the coffee in Firebolts face and quickly flew over to see if Firebolt was okay. Luckily, the hot coffee didn't hurt Firebolt because he was a dragon. Puff and Firebolt decided to go get lunch. 
When they were walking on the street, they found there is a new restaurant opened in the corner. That seemed has great salads with Firebolt's favorite guacamole. They had a great time together. The end!!
